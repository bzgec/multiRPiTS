# PID-fan-controller
For controlling fan of Raspberry Pi

This code is inspired by Andreas Spiess and his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ.
His two videos (https://youtu.be/P5o0PpfzuW8?list=PL3XBzmAj53RnezxZ_uq8YMymURnnLTqZP and https://youtu.be/oJ32CMxliCQ?list=PL3XBzmAj53RnezxZ_uq8YMymURnnLTqZP) were the base for this code.

If you are going to use this code, configure PIDs for that will suit your needs.

And if you have any suggestions please let me know.
