# PID-fan-controller
For controlling fan of Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS

This code is inspired by Andreas Spiess and his YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ.

His two videos were the base for this code (https://youtu.be/P5o0PpfzuW8?list=PL3XBzmAj53RnezxZ_uq8YMymURnnLTqZP and https://youtu.be/oJ32CMxliCQ?list=PL3XBzmAj53RnezxZ_uq8YMymURnnLTqZP).

If you are going to use this code, change PIDs that will suit your needs.
This code is ment to start on boot and run indefinitely.

And if you have any suggestions please let me know.
